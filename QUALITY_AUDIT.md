# Recursive Watch Quality Audit

This file is the sole progress and findings ledger for recursive-watch quality
work in this fork.

## Reference

```text
Repository: MK796/fsnotify
Upstream base: 20b1e15
Validated implementation: fce4bab
Validated reference tag: recursive-watch-validation-v1
Working branch: quality/recursive-watch-v1
Contract tag: not valid until created on a green main commit
```

Production-code auditing starts only after the fencing pull request is merged,
the contract is validly tagged on `main`, and branch protection is active.

## Entry Format

Every finding uses:

```text
ID:
Severity:
Status:
Contract:
Backend:
Finding:
Evidence:
Decision:
Fix commit:
Validation runs:
```

Allowed ID prefixes:

- `AUDIT-COMMON-*`
- `AUDIT-INOTIFY-*`
- `AUDIT-WIN-*`
- `AUDIT-KQUEUE-*`
- `AUDIT-FEN-*`
- `AUDIT-TEST-*`
- `AUDIT-CI-*`
- `AUDIT-PERF-*`

Allowed severities:

- `BLOCKER`
- `MAJOR`
- `MINOR`

Allowed statuses:

- `OPEN`
- `IN_PROGRESS`
- `RESOLVED`
- `ACCEPTED_NATIVE_EVENT`
- `ACCEPTED_NATIVE_CAPABILITY`
- `ACCEPTED_TEST_ENVIRONMENT`

A Recursive Control Contract difference cannot use an `ACCEPTED_*` status.

## Findings

No production-audit finding is open. Production-code auditing has not started.

### AUDIT-TEST-001 | MAJOR | IN_PROGRESS

ID: `AUDIT-TEST-001`

Severity: `MAJOR`

Status: `IN_PROGRESS`

Contract: `RC-023`, `RC-024`, `RC-027`

Backend: all

Finding: Recursive script outputs and capability directives need a complete,
machine-checked classification. A file path alone is not evidence that the
non-recursive behavior executes on the affected backend.

Evidence: `testdata/watch-recurse`; `testdata/watch-dir`;
`.github/policy/recursive-platform-exceptions.json`.

Decision: Inventory every recursive platform selector and execute every
referenced non-recursive script on each affected backend.

Fix commit: `test: enforce recursive platform exception policy`

Validation runs:

### AUDIT-TEST-002 | BLOCKER | IN_PROGRESS

ID: `AUDIT-TEST-002`

Severity: `BLOCKER`

Status: `IN_PROGRESS`

Contract: `RC-024`

Backend: Windows/IOCP

Finding: The existing ancestor-rename scenario is skipped on Windows and
therefore cannot prove that Windows itself rejects renaming an ancestor while a
separately watched descendant holds an open directory handle.

Evidence: `fsnotify_test.go`;
`testdata/watch-dir/rename-nested-watched-dir`.

Decision: Add and execute a non-recursive Windows test that watches only the
descendant and asserts that the filesystem rename operation itself fails.

Fix commit: `test: enforce recursive platform exception policy`

Validation runs:

### AUDIT-TEST-003 | MAJOR | IN_PROGRESS

ID: `AUDIT-TEST-003`

Severity: `MAJOR`

Status: `IN_PROGRESS`

Contract: `RC-024`

Backend: Windows/IOCP

Finding: Exact recursive tree-removal transcripts are skipped on Windows. The
exception needs executable non-recursive evidence for the underlying
per-directory `ReadDirectoryChangesW` event behavior.

Evidence: `testdata/watch-recurse/remove-dir`;
`testdata/watch-recurse/remove-watched-dir`;
`testdata/watch-dir/subdir`.

Decision: Execute the non-recursive parent-directory script on Windows and keep
the exception limited to raw event representation. Recursive cleanup and
ownership remain mandatory in the common contract suite.

Fix commit: `test: enforce recursive platform exception policy`

Validation runs:

## Platform Exceptions

Every platform exception must be represented in
`.github/policy/recursive-platform-exceptions.json` and must reference a
matching `AUDIT-TEST-*` finding.

No exception is accepted merely because a path or test file exists. The
non-recursive evidence must execute on the affected platform and assert the
claimed native behavior.

## Benchmarks And Resources

No performance or resource baseline has been established yet. This work starts
only after the contract freeze, as required by the quality plan.

## Decisions

- The Recursive Control Contract is platform-identical.
- Native event, capability, and test-environment differences remain separate
  from recursive control semantics.
- Contract tests are not changed to accommodate production behavior.
- Builds and platform tests run only on GitHub-hosted runners.
- The user retains manual control over pull-request publication and merge.
